# My-Portfolio

# Hi, I'm John Cedrick Asad

I’m an IT Support specialist pivoting into Android Development.  
I build practical, user‑focused apps — from utilities like **Battery Notifier** and **App Lock**, to business‑driven solutions like **Mobile Reports**.  
My strength is bridging support, infrastructure, and development, delivering prototypes and solutions that solve real operational problems.  
I’m now focused on mastering Android (Compose, Material3, secure flows) and building a portfolio that proves my capability to deliver end‑to‑end applications.
